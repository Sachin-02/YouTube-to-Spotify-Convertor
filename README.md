This repository contains the code for my YouTube to Spotify convertor using python. 

I started this project coming out of my first work term where I was assisting in the devlelopment of a progressive web application. I was introduced to and learned a lot about API's, so I wanted to expand my knowledge and familiarity with them. I came across a video on YouTube of someone converting a YouTube playlist to Spotify using a python script. I thought this would be a great way for me to become more experienced using API's and also further develop my python skills so I decided to recreate the project myself. This was also beneficial to me since I had a lot of music on YouTube and a large part of why I didn't want to switch to spotify was because I didn't want to manually recreate all the playlists. 

The script starts off by accessing the users YouTube account and getting the desired playlist. Due to the YouTube API limitations, only a maximum of 50 songs can be obtained. My script then parses the data and puts all the songs into a list, filtering out words like "lyrics" or "music video" since those are commonly in YouTube titles. Using the Spotify API, it then creates a new spotify playlist and searches for each song in the list, taking the first search result (if any exist) and placing it into the newly created playlist.
